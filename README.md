Key: 
Matrix mul = matrix mul
matrix runtime1 = matrix addition

To look at the code for these, you need to go deeper down in each folder under their repective names until you get to matrix mul or matrix addition folder, in the folder will be the kernel.cu file and the recpective project, this folder has the code you can view.
This project is just a look into NIVDA's cuda that I experimented with by doing linear operations.
